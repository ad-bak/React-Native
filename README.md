# React Native + Expo

This repository is where I learn and store my React Native projects built with Expo.

## How to navigate?

Simply switch branches to navigate between projects.

## Important!

I mostly used an iPhone 14 Pro to build these projects, so it's highly likely that some of them may not look as good on Android devices or smaller screens.
